# How to assemble the robotic arm
1.	We put the base of the arm called "base".
2.	Place the "waist" piece over the "base", make sure that the motor part stays out.
3.	Attach "Arm01" with the outer part of the waist vertically, so that the part with a small protrusion is down - please make sure the holes are aligned with each other-.
4.	Attach " Arm02" to the upper end of "Arm01", note that the semicircular part of the "Arm02" is at the bottom, keep the motors out.
5.	We put "gripper" on top of "Arm02".
6.	*Note that the gripper has been scaled to 400% from the original size due to a mismatch size.
